<p>Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Carroll School of Business at Boston College.</p>
<p>My research interests fall broadly in consumer behavior and branding. Specifically, my work examines the joint influence of brand-level factors, including brand concepts (e.g., heritage, warmth), and features (e.g., pronunciation difficulty of brand names), as well as a variety of brand actions, including social media engagement, advertising, and corporate social responsibility. I follow an experimental approach to investigate how consumers respond to various brand actions.</p>
<p>I received my Ph.D. from Rutgers University in 2021. I also hold two B.S. degrees in Business Administration and Management (with Marketing concentration) from Middle East Technical University (Turkey) and Binghamton University, and an MBA in Marketing Management from Pace University.</p>
<p>In addition to advancing my research, I worked as the behavioral lab coordinator at Rutgers Business School (RBS), and I am currently managing the Consumer Insight Panel lab in the Carroll School Marketing Department.</p>
<p>Apart from academia, I enjoy exploring new places, listening to traditional folk music from around the world, and gardening.</p>
