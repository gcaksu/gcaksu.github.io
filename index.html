<p>Hi! I am a PhD Candidate in Marketing at Rutgers Business School.</p>
<p>I received two B.S. degrees in Business Administration and Management (with Marketing concentration) from Middle East Technical University (Turkey) and Binghamton University. I also hold an MBA in Marketing Management from Pace University. During my MBA program, I worked as a research assistant, which sparked my interest in consumer research, and as a result, led me to pursue a PhD in marketing at Rutgers.</p>
<p>My primary research interest is understanding consumer responses to digital marketing and innovative brand actions. Specifically, my work examines the joint influence of brand concepts and brands’ new media (i.e., social media) engagement on consumer attitudes and decision making. I also examine other brand-level factors, including brand warmth, and the pronunciation difficulty of brand names, as well as a variety of brand actions, including advertising and corporate social responsibility. My research follows an experimental approach and makes important contributions to digital/social media marketing, brand management, and global marketing.</p>
<p>In addition, I also worked as a behavioral lab coordinator at Rutgers Business School (RBS), where we conducted research studies in Marketing, Management and Accounting for faculty and PhD students.</p>
<p>Apart from academia, I enjoy exploring new places, listening to traditional folk music from around the world, and gardening.</p>
