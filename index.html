<p>Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Boston College and an incoming Assistant Professor of Marketing at UMass-Boston.</p>
<p>My research interests lie in understanding consumer attitudes and decision-making by examining various brand-level and consumer-level factors. My research spans a variety of brand components, including brand concepts (e.g., heritage and warmth) and features (e.g., brand names), various consumer-level factors (e.g., self-construal and dialectical thinking), as well as a variety of brand behaviors (e.g., social media use and corporate social responsibility).</p>
<p>I completed my undergraduate studies (BS) in Business Administration and Management at Binghamton University and Middle East Technical University (Turkey). I graduated from Pace University with an MBA in Marketing Management. I received my PhD in Marketing from Rutgers University.</p>
<p>I also have extensive experience working as a Behavioral Lab Coordinator at Rutgers University and Boston College. I have been closely involved in coordinating the participant pool and managing behavioral studies.</p>
<p>When I am not working, I enjoy exploring new places, listening to traditional folk music from around the world, and gardening.</p>
